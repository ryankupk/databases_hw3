/**
 * This program is a very simple Web server.  When it receives a HTTP request
 * it sends the request back as the reply.  This can be of interest when
 * you want to see just what a Web client is requesting, or what data is
 * being sent when a form is submitted, for example.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * 	java HttpMirror 
 * 
 * The idea for this is motivated from "Java Examples in a NutShell".
